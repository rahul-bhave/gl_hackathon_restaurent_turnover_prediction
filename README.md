# gl_hackathon_restaurent_turnover_prediction
Goal:

The goal of this problem is to predict the Annual Turnover of a restaurant based on the variables provided in the data set. 

Metric to measure

The measure of accuracy will be RMSE (Root mean square error)

The predicted Annual Turnover for each restaurant in the Test dataset will be compared with the actual Annual Turnover to calculate the RMSE value of the entire prediction. The lower the RMSE value, the better the model will be.

Submission File Format:
You are to submit a  '.csv' file with exactly 500 entries plus a header row. The file should have exactly two columns

1.    Registration Number
2.    Annual Turnover
